      <p>
        When a buyer pays for a product through the link a seller either generates or accepts, the payment is
held in escrow and the seller is notified of the payment. The seller then delivers the product or service
to the buyer. When the buyer receives the product, the delivery person ensures that the buyer confirms
the transaction to release the money from escrow. The money is sent to the sellerâ€™s paylidate wallet
which can be transferred to any bank or used to pay for other services through the virtual cards.
