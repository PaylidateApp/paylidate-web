          platforms in amarket place environment that consists of millions of users with a desire to either 
          buy or sell something. Technology has played an important role in developing the environment for 
          these market places. However, the few challenges experienced pose a great threat to a sustainable 
          e-commerce culture especially in this part of the world. <br/><br/>
          Social media and Classified ads hold a 
          thousand opportunities for vendors to sell their products. This is hindered by alot of bad online 
          trade experiences. <br/><br/>
          Some of these experiences include: <br/>
          <ol>
            <li>(Payment before delivery) Paying an online vendor for a product and never getting the product 
          delivered to you</li><br/>
            <li>Paying and then getting a substandard product</li> <br/>
            <li>Getting your money back after a failed or wrong delivery</li><br/>
            <li>(Cash on delivery) A vendor expecting to be paid at the point of delivering a product but 
          not finding the buyer because they don't have the money, so all the logistics expenses are 
          wasted. etc.</li>
